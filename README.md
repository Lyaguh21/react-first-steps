# React + SÐ¡SS

## the first web interface for React and SCSS, I tried to implement interesting mechanics for myself. Of interest, there is a reminder board where you can create notes and delete them. There are a lot of bugs (I was too lazy to fix it) and there were plans to add a theme change.

## Launch

- npm install node-sass
- npm i
- npm run dev
